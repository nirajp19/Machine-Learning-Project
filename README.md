# Machine-Learning-Project

In the Milk Quality Prediction project, I utilized machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for assessing and predicting the quality of milk based on various key parameters. The project involved extensive data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and model building to achieve accurate predictions.
